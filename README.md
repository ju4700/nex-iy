Dynamic Chat Spaces:

- Channels for projects, but with contextual threads — tasks automatically generate mini-threads for discussions, keeping chats organized.
- Focus mode for quiet, distraction-free collaboration — useful for deep work.

Integrated Task Management:

- Tasks can be created directly from chat messages — just type /task "Design homepage" due: tomorrow.
- Task cards show progress, blockers, and comments — a blend of Kanban and chat threads.

Daily Check-in & Reports:

- A quick stand-up bot that asks for daily goals and roadblocks — updates are visible in a "Daily Pulse" section.
- Smart summaries of chat discussions and tasks for the day.

Creative Meeting Rooms:

- Virtual rooms with integrated timers, collaborative docs, and AI-powered meeting notes.
- Add “mood boards” or “idea pools” for each meeting.

Smart Integrations:

- Seamlessly link with GitHub, Google Drive, Notion, etc.
- A built-in AI assistant that suggests task prioritization based on deadlines and team activity.

Role-based Collaboration:

- Founders, team leads, and interns — all have tailored views, ensuring access to what matters most to them.
- Real-time feedback loops — send and receive feedback directly on tasks.
